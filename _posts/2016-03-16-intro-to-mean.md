App based on this tutorial : https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular

For Windows:

1. Mongo DB
Requires an installation. Fairly straight forward here: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
Just NB that it will install the app here: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin

Start DB: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin\mongod.exe
Connect to DB: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin\mongo.exe
Connection string: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/

2. NodeJS and NPM
Download the Windows installer from the Nodes.js® web site.
Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.
Test Node: node -v
Test NPM: npm -v

Not sure if this is a thing, but killing the running node process in cmd requires a Ctrl+Shift+C combo.

3. Express Framework
This is downloaded automatically with NPM.

4. AngularJS
OMG no installation required.
