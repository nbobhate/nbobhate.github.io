Along the creeks and rivers of Western North Carolina, the Cherokee once had a particular way of capturing sicklefin redhorse.<!--more-->

Large stone weirs — a V-shaped alignment of rocks and boulders — were placed in the water adjacent settlements. A trap at the apex helped ensnare the fish, known to them as junghitla — which translated to “wearing a red feather,” a reference to the coloration of the fish’s fins.

Reaching up two 2-feet-long and weighing up to 7 pounds, sicklefin redhorse provided a high-protein food source, and they were valued also for their good taste.

“Fishing for the Cherokee community was a family affair,” said Mike LaVoie, program manager for fish and wildlife management for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. “Parents and children and elders were all involved in these big fishing events with these weirs.”

Now centuries later, sicklefin red horse is generating high concern among scientists worried for the future of the fish, which is found only in the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee river drainages in Jackson, Macon, Swain, Clay and Cherokee counties in North Carolina and Towns County in Georgia.

A collection of groups have promised to spend at least $400,000 over the next decade on efforts to save the sicklefin redhorse, taking advantage of a relatively new way of protecting a species on the way toward being listed as endangered.

River dam levels, among other steps will be monitored the way the Cherokee would have keep an eye on stream levels centuries ago, and the Eastern Band will put emphasis fostering cultural awareness.

The effort — led by government agencies and two utilities — is expected to serve as example of what can be done before it’s too late — and how sometimes working to designate a species as endangered is solution with only a checkered success rate.

Of the roughly 2,000 species to have been listed as threatened or endangered, 28 have made it off the list due to their recovery.

“Our hope is to conserve a vulnerable fish species that had a distinct cultural value to the tribe, as well as to reconnect those cultural values to the Cherokee community through various outreach activities,” LaVoie said.
