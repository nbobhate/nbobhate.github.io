There are two important parts to setting up a variable:
1. Declaration: *type name;*
2. Instantiation: *name = value;*

These steps can, and typically are, combined:
```java
int index = 5;
boolean condition = true;
```
You can declare and even instantiate multiple variables in the same line. This usually decreases readability and is considered bad practise.
```java
int a,b,c;
double rate = 0.5, pi = 3.14;
int idx = 5, ctt;
```
Variables are *dynamically initialised* when they are assigned an expression that will only be resolved at runtime.

In Java, code is declared in *blocks* delineated by `{ }`. Any code enclosed by braces is said to be within the same *scope*. A variable declared within a set of braces is only available to the code within that scope. Any attempts to access the variable from outside the scope it is declared in will result in a compiler error. Once execution has completed within a block of code, the variables declared within that scope are destroyed.
