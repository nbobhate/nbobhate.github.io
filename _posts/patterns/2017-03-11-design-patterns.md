Design patterns are a way of solving common problems that software developers may face. Each pattern describes a particular problem and provides a description of the basic outline of the  solution to this problem.

Making use of design patterns results in software that has improved design that is more elegant and flexible. Design patterns also improve communication between developers by introducing a common vocabulary when discussing problems and solutions.

Design patterns are generally split into three main categories that describe their purpose or intent. These are Creational, Structural, and Behavioural. Creational patterns solve problems concerning how objects are constructed. Structural patterns describe how classes should be composed in order to solve a problem. Behavioural patterns describe how objects should interact in order to solve a problem.

Patterns in these categories are further split according to their scope: either Class or Object. Class scoped patterns are static definitions of how classes should relate to one another, such as by use of inheritance, etc. Object scoped patterns define how objects work dynamically in a runtime environment.

The table below illustrates how the more popular design patterns are categorised:

|             | Class           | Object                  |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Creational  | Factory Method  | Abstract Factory        |
|             |                 | Builder                 |
|             |                 | Prototype               |
|             |                 | Singleton               |
| Structural  | Adaptor         | Adaptor                 |
|             |                 | Bridge                  |
|             |                 | Composite               |
|             |                 | Decorator               |
|             |                 | Facade                  |
|             |                 | Flyweight               |
|             |                 | Proxy                   |
| Behavioural | Interpreter     | Chain of Responsibility |
|             | Template Method | Command                 |
|             |                 | Iterator                |
|             |                 | Mediator                |
|             |                 | Memento                 |
|             |                 | Observer                |
|             |                 | State                   |
|             |                 | Strategy                |
