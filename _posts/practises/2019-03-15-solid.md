The SOLID principles define five basic OOP best practises. These principles contribute to the design and maintainability of software applications and should be adhered to as closely as possible.

## Single Responsibility Principle

The _Single Responsibility Principle_ is pretty self explanatory, but can be the one best practice that is easily ignored. The results of which are _God Classes_ which are a nightmare to maintain for new or existing developers.

In essence this principle states that a class should only be able to perform actions that it is directly responsible for. Sounds pretty obvoious but this distinction does get a bit blurry. The key is to always bear in mind the purpose of your class.

For example, let's say we have a `Book` class. We have some operations that we want to perform with `Book`.
{% highlight java %}
public class Book {

  public String getTitle() {
    return "Some title";
  }

  public String getAuthor() {
    return "Some author";
  }

  public Page getCurrentPage() {
    // Return the current page
  }

  public void printPage() {
    // Print the current page
  }

  public void save() {
    // Save book to file
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `Book` class is currently responsible for returning metadata about itself (title, author), printing a page, and saving itself to a file. The last two operations violate the _Single Responsibility Principle_ because `Book` shouldn't need to worry about how it should be printed and to what format, nor how it is saved. These operations can be removed and the responsibility can be granted to other classes.

We can remove the printing operations and create a class specifically responsible for printing pages. This makes it easier to mamange things like printing to different types of output, printing multiple pages, etc.
{% highlight java %}
public interface Printer {
  public void printPage(Page page);
}

public class PlainTextPrinter implements Printer {
  public void printPage(Page page) {
    // print the page as plain text
  }
}

public class PDFPrinter implements Printer {
  public void printPage(Page page) {
    // print the page as a PDF
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

So what does `Book` look like now? We can remove the `printPage()` method as we have another class that is responsible for this operation.
{% highlight java %}
public class Book {

  public String getTitle() {
    return "Some title";
  }

  public String getAuthor() {
    return "Some author";
  }

  public Page getCurrentPage() {
    // Return the current page
  }

  public void save() {
    // Save book to DB
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

When we want to then print a page from a `Book` instance, we can do so as follows,
{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Book book = new Book();
  Printer printer = new PlainTextPrinter();
  printer.printPage(book.getCurrentPage());
}
{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, we can remove the saving responsibility from the `Book` class and create a specific class that handles this operation.
{% highlight java %}
public class SimpleFilePersistance {
  public void save(Book book) {
    // Persist the book to a file
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our `Book` class is now much simpler and more cohesive:
{% highlight java %}
public class Book {

  public String getTitle() {
    return "Some title";
  }

  public String getAuthor() {
    return "Some author";
  }

  public Page getCurrentPage() {
    // Return the current page
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can use the `SimpleFilePersistance` class as follows.
{% highlight java %}
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Book book = new Book();

  Printer printer = new PlainTextPrinter();
  printer.printPage(book.getCurrentPage());

  SimpleFilePersistance simpleFilePersistance = new SimpleFilePersistance();
  simpleFilePersistance.save(book);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Open-Closed Principle

The _Open-Closed Principle_ states that software modules, whether methods or classes, should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Basically, changes to existing software should cause minimal (if any) changes to already working and tested code. If developers are constantly updating existing code and thereby tests, to cater for changing requirements then the overall design is considered fragile.

For example, let's say that we have an `Instrument` class. From this we can create subclasses `Violin` and `Flute`.
{% highlight java %}
public class Instrument {
  private String name;
  public Instrument(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

public class Violin extends Instrument {
  private final static String name = "Violin";
  public Violin() {
    super(name);
  }
}

public class Flute extends Instrument {
  private final static String name = "Flute";
  public Flute() {
    super(name);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we need a conductor to manage our instruments. First we set out the various actions that each instrument must complete. Then the conductor calls on the actions for each instrument in turn.
{% highlight java %}
public class Conductor {

  public void conduct(Instrument instrument) {
    if (instrument instanceof Violin) {
      playSadSolo();
      playQuickStrings();
    } else if (instrument instanceof Flute) {
      playSingleToot();
    }
  }

  // Violin
  private void playSadSolo() {
    System.out.println("Sad solo");
  }

  private void playQuickStrings() {
    System.out.println("Quick Strings!!");
  }

  // Flute
  private void playSingleToot() {
    System.out.println("Single toot");
  }

  // etc
}
{% endhighlight %}

It should be immediately obvious that this design is bad and not maintainable. Firstly, the `Conductor` class violates the _Single Responsibility Principle_ and knows too much about what each instrument should be responsible for. Secondly, the `conduct()` method already violates the _Open-Closed Principle_: if there are any new instruments the condition will have to be modified to accomodate them. This is the negative side effect of using `if-else` or `switch` statements in this manner.

Lets untangle the mess by first fixing the Single Responsibility violation by moving the actions each instrument is responsible for into their respective classes. We change the `Instrument` class to an abstract class with an abstract method `play()` that all the subclasses will have to implement.
{% highlight java %}
public abstract class Instrument {
  private String name;
  public Instrument(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public void play();
}

public class Violin extends Instrument {
  private final static String name = "Violin";

  public Violin() {
    super(name);
  }

  @Override
  public void play() {
    playSadSolo();
    playQuickStrings();
  }

  private void playSadSolo() {
    System.out.println("Sad solo");
  }

  private void playQuickStrings() {
    System.out.println("Quick Strings!!");
  }
}

public class Flute extends Instrument {
  private final static String name = "Flute";

  public Flute() {
    super(name);
  }

  @Override
  public void play() {
    playSingleToot();
  }

  private void playSingleToot() {
    System.out.println("Single toot");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can clean up `Conductor` as well by removing the `instanceof` check and calling the `play()` method that is overriden in the `Instrument` subclasses. Now when a new instrument is added, the `Conductor` class doesn't have to be modified to accommodate it.
{% highlight java %}
public class Conductor {

  public void conduct(Instrument instrument) {
    instrument.play();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Incidentally, the above solution is also known as a Strategy Pattern.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

The _Liskov Substitution Principle_ states that subclasses must be substitutable for their superclass. All subclasses of a superclass must share an *IS-A* relationship with the superclass. If a subclass doesn't share all the inherited state from the superclass, then the subclass is violating the Liskov Substitution principle.

As an example, we have a superclass representing a `Teacher`.
{% highlight java %}
public abstract class Teacher {
  public abstract void teach();

  public void otherDuties() {
    System.out.println("Performing other duties.");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following classes, `ScienceTeacher` and `MathTeacher`, both inherit all the behaviour present in the superclass `Teacher`.
{% highlight java %}
public class ScienceTeacher extends Teacher {
  @Overrides
  public void teach() {
    System.out.println("Teaching science!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class MathTeacher extends Teacher {
  @Overrides
  public void teach() {
    System.out.println("Teaching math!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

So far so good. Lets say that there exists a post called `TeachingAssistant`. How would we model this? An instance of `TeachingAssistant` certainly performs other duties, but they don't teach. Allowing `TeachingAssistant` to extend `Teacher` just to inherit some behaviour violates the Liskov Substitution principle in the following ways.

Firstly, allowing `TeachingAssistant` to be a derivative of `Teacher` has created a situation where the client will have to have knowledge of `TeachingAssistant` in order to avoid calling the `teach()` method. Secondly, we can accommodate for this by having the `teach()` method in `TeachingAssistant` return nothing or throw an exception, but this forces the superclass, or contract, to change. This is indicative of bad design and should be avoided.

In this instance, we can solve this by removing the behaviour of *teaching* into an interface and introduce a new class `SchoolStaff` as our superclass.
{% highlight java %}
public interface Teacher {
  public void teach();
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class SchoolStaff {
  public void otherDuties() {
    System.out.println("Performing other duties.");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our teaching staff now change to implement the interface `Teacher`, and extend from `SchoolStaff`.
{% highlight java %}
public class ScienceTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements Teacher {
  @Overrides
  public void teach() {
    System.out.println("Teaching science!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
public class MathTeacher extends SchoolStaff implements Teacher {
  @Overrides
  public void teach() {
    System.out.println("Teaching math!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `TeachingAssistant` now extends `SchoolStaff`.
{% highlight java %}
public class TeachingAssistant extends SchoolStaff {

}
{% endhighlight %}

This may seem like a lengthy process but this design adheres to the Liskov Substitution principle. Both the `ScienceTeacher` and `MathTeacher` share an *IS-A* relationship with `SchoolStaff` and `Teacher`. The `TeachingAssistant` *IS-A* `SchoolStaff` without clients expecting it to also be a `Teacher`.

When deciding how to structure subclasses, simply ask if all the behaviour of the superclass should be applied to the subclass. If an aspect of the superclass behaviour doesn't make sense for the subclass, you are more than likely violating the Liskov Substitution principle by forcing the association.

## Interface Segregation Principle

The _Interface Segregation Principle_ simply states that clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use. This is often the case when inheriting from *fat* classes (classes that have too many responsibilities).

Lets look at the simple example below. We have an interface called `Travel` that allows the implementing client to travel via different modes of transport.
{% highlight java %}
public interface Travel {
  public void travelbyBus();
  public void travelByTrain();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now lets introduce a class that will implement `Travel`. For argument's sake we have a class `Freight` that must be transported somehow. It makes sense for `Freight` to travel by train, but not by bus. However, since `Freight` is implementing `Travel`, it is forced to have an implementation of the `travelbyBus()` method. This clearly violates the Interface Segregation principle.
{% highlight java %}
public class Freight implements Travel {
  @Override
  public void travelbyBus() {
    //...
  }

  @Override
  public void travelByTrain() {
    //...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `Travel` interface should rather be split into two separate interfaces as follows.
{% highlight java %}
public interface BusTravel {
  public void travelbyBus();
}

public interface TrainTravel {
  public void travelByTrain();
}
{% endhighlight %}

This allows `Freight` to implement the interface that it requires without having to worry about handling responsibilities it doesn't need.
{% highlight java %}
public class Freight implements TrainTravel {
  @Override
  public void travelByTrain() {
    //...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency Inversion is the last of the **SOLID Principles**.

This principle states that in software design, high level modules should not depend on low level modules. Low level modules are generally prone to change as the software evolves, and these changes will ripple out and affect all the higher level modules depending on them.

Rather, both should depend on *abstractions*. Abstractions are not tied down by the details of the implementation, but rather should drive the implementation process by providing *contracts* that subclasses must adhere to. These contracts are less prone to change once they are defined. Abstractions in Java can be realised by the use of `abstract` or `interface` classes.

Lets look at some code. For this example, we have a manufacturing factory that produces various devices. All these devices go through the same steps:

- Assembly
- Testing
- Packaging
- Storage

However, for each device the actual details of each step varies. The manufacturer doesn't need to know what these details are; they just need to be able to ensure that each device goes through each step. Lets start with creating our abstract contract.
{% highlight java %}
package processes;
public abstract class ManufacturingProcess {
  protected void assemble();
  protected void test();
  protected void packaging();
  protected void store();

  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now lets create some devices that we can manufacture. Each subclass of `ManufacturingProcess` is forced to implement the abstract methods defined in the superclass.
{% highlight java %}
package processes;
public class LaptopManufacturer extends ManufacturingProcess {

  @Override
  protected void assemble() {
    System.out.println("Assembling a Laptop");
  }

  @Override
  protected void test() {
    System.out.println("Testing the Laptop");
  }

  @Override
  protected void packaging() {
    System.out.println("Packaging the Laptop");
  }

  @Override
  protected void store() {
    System.out.println("Storing the Laptop");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
package processes;
public class TabletManufacturer extends ManufacturingProcess {

  @Override
  protected void assemble() {
    System.out.println("Assembling a Tablet");
  }

  @Override
  protected void test() {
    System.out.println("Testing the Tablet");
  }

  @Override
  protected void packaging() {
    System.out.println("Packaging the Tablet");
  }

  @Override
  protected void store() {
    System.out.println("Storing the Tablet");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In order to ensure that the steps are invoked in the correct order, we can define a method in the superclass that makes the method calls correctly. The `launch()` method doesn't need to worry about the details of each step for each device. It simply stipulates the method order that will be called on the instance of the subclass.
{% highlight java %}
package processes;
public abstract class ManufacturingProcess {
  protected void assemble();
  protected void test();
  protected void packaging();
  protected void store();

  public void launch() {
    assemble();
    test();
    packaging();
    store();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Incidentally, the `launch()` method is an example of applying the Template pattern.

This allows the manufacturer to disregard the concrete types during the manufacturing process, and rather depends on the contract provided by the abstraction. Note that in this case, we have defined all of our process-related classes in a different package, and the methods defined in `ManufacturingProcess` are defined as `protected`. This measn that the instance of `ManufacturingProcess` defined in `Factory` only has access to the `launch()` method. Now the manufacturer doesn't need to know the details about each device's manufacturing process. They can simply invoke the process!
{% highlight java %}
package clients;
public class Factory {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ManufacturingProcess laptopManufacturer = new LaptopManufacturer();
    laptopManufacturer.launch();

    ManufacturingProcess tabletManufacturer = new TabletManufacturer();
    tabletManufacturer.launch();
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
